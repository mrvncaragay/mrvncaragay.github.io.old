      One problem that my previous company i worked on was their Lost and Found system. The Security
      team used excel spreadsheet to log lost and found items. I've upgraded their system to Power
      app but i wasnt able to do much with power apps. i have decided to re-create this system using
      Node, express, MongoDB, and React in the front-end.

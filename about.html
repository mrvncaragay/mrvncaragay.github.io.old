  <h2>Hello, my name is <span>Marvin Caragay</span>.</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a self-taught Full-Stack Developer. I have a B.S. degree in Software Engineering at San Jose
    State University. I worked as an IT Specialist for more than two years, but I decided to leave
    and pursue my passion for Software Development. For the past four months, I've been building
    personal projects using MERN stack. This goal has become a full-pledged that only gets more
    exciting every day. You can check out my projects on the <em>Projects</em> tab. Thank You.
